# lissajous
A Lissajous curve visualizer.

This is a visualizer that visualizes 16 Lissajous curves using p5.js.  Going from left to right, the parameter a increases from 1 to 4, and going from top to bottom, the parameter b increases from 1 to 4.  

You can change the number of visualizations by changing the stopping point of the loop at the bottom of sketch.js.

Here it is in action:
